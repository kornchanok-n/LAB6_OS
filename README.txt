How to run benchmark.

1. compile client.c and server.c use "make all"
2. open server use "./server {PORT}"
3. run benchmark.sh use "bash benchmark.sh {IP} {PORT}"

I also have my result with benchmarking in file "TransferLog1" (Transfer in local host) and "TransferLog2" (Transfer to another device)
